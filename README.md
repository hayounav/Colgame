# What is this?
An open-source Android/Desktop port of Sid Meier's Colonization made with LibGDX on Android Studio.
At least initially, we will try to stay as true to the original game as possible (given the information we have available).

# Why is this?
[Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) is great for playing Civ V on the phone, but I like Colonization better.
[FreeCol](https://github.com/FreeCol/freecol) is only available on the desktop, and has progressed way beyond the original game.

# [Credits and 3rd parties]
Will be adding credit here for any assets/code we use
